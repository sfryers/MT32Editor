MT-32 Editor - a patch editor and librarian for MT-32/CM-32L and compatible MIDI synthesizers

Release Notes

v0.9.9b - 13th April 2024
  Bug Fixes:
    - Pitch Envelope Velocity Sensitivity parameter now stores the full range of permitted values from 0-100 (bug in previous versions caused the internal range of values for this parameter to be restricted to 0-14).
    - Framework version and architecture detected at compile time instead of relying on hard-coded strings.
    - Tweaked SysEx delay timings to improve compatibility with hardware MT-32 under Wine environment.
  New Features:
    - Timbre Editor now includes undo/redo function
    - Application now attempts to read incomplete patch data rather than ignoring it.
    - Ability to display raw SysEx data in the console window- can be enabled by editing the .ini file.
  Miscellaneous:
    - Improved sizing and spacing of certain UI elements.
    - Code improvements- added further summary information and refactored some methods.
    - Project can now target .NET 6.0 and .NET 4.7.2 from a common codebase.

v0.9.8a - 16th March 2024
  Bug Fixes:
    - Saving over an existing SysEx file properly clears the file before writing new data. In previous versions, overwriting a file with a smaller one could cause invalid data to remain at the end of the file.
    - System area messages in saved SysEx files now have correct checksum value.
    - Blank MT-32 text messages are no longer saved to SysEx files.
    - Text labels for Master Volume, Master Tune and Reverb Level controls are now updated properly when values are changed.
    - Selecting 'Clear all memory timbres' no longer leaves custom timbre names showing in Patch and Rhythm Bank lists.
    - Last Memory Timbre entry in Patch Editor->Timbre Name combobox now shows correctly.
    - Last Memory Timbre entry in Patch Editor->Edit Preset combobox now shows correctly.
    - Rhythm Bank Editor now includes key no. 108
    - TVA/TVF Bias Pt. note range labels now show correctly again.
    - Midi ports are now kept open until the user has confirmed they want to close the application.
  New Features:
    - Selectable dark or light UI theme.
    - Parts 1-8 and R can now be disabled by assigning a MIDI channel value of 0 to the corresponding part.
    - Warning message appears if Part 1 or Rhythm Part is assigned to MIDI channel value of 0.
    - 'Unit No.' parameter has been added to MT32Edit.ini. This should normally be left at the default value of 17, except for when working with multiple hardware MT-32 devices. Any SysEx files saved when this value is set to a value other than 17 will not be recognised with other devices. This value is not shown in the UI and can only be changed by editing the .ini file.
  Miscellaneous:
    - Code improvements- added comments, removed redundant/duplicate code, increased use of constants, tightened access modifiers.
    - Added further summary information to methods.
    - Reduced internal refresh rate from 100ms to 250ms to improve UI responsiveness on slow CPUs or in a Wine/Mono environment.

    - App shows pop-up message when an opened file does not contain any valid MT-32 SysEx data. 
    - App can now open .syx, .mid and .timbre files at start-up (either by entering a command line parameter, [right click]->[Open with]->[Choose another app], or by drag-and-dropping a file on to the MT-32 Editor icon).
    - Current memory state will be retained if an attempt is made to open a file containing no valid MT-32 SysEx data.
    - MT-32 text message data is displayed in upload window during SysEx upload process.
    - Name of currently loaded file is shown in window title bar.
    - Added option to show/hide console window added.
    - Added option to ignore system settings when loading or saving a SysEx file.

    - Some Keyfollow Ratio values were incorrectly labelled due to corresponding error in MT-32 manual. All values are now as per CM-32L manual.
    - Copy/pasting timbres no longer causes partial checkboxes to affect both original and copied timbre.
